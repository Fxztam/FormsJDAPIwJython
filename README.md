### FormsExtractCode
Extracting of complete Oracle Forms PL/SQL code in a single file https://github.com/Fxztam/FormsJDAPIwJython/blob/master/FormsExtractCode.py 

This PoC runs with Jython 2.7.0 from http://www.jython.org/downloads.html : 


### Motivation
The one file of the complete Oracle Forms PL/SQL code can be a good input for analyzing this code,
Jython is a good basic for Low Code handlings of JDAPI 

### Running
Adapting the full qualified files in:
- line 73
- line 77
- line 78 .

A output demo from https://github.com/Fxztam/FormsFileWatcher/blob/master/chk_fwatchself.fmb is viewing in https://github.com/Fxztam/FormsJDAPIwJython/blob/master/chk_fwatchself.sql .
